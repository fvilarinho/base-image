Synopsys
========

This a base image to build Docker containers.
It's based on Alpine Linux and contains a basic structure and tools for a container such as:

- `bash / bash-completion`
- `vim / jq`
- `zip / unzip / tar / gzip`
- `curl / wget`
- `bind-tools / net-tools / whois / telnet`
- `openssh-client`


The directory structure of the container is defined by the environment variables described below:

- `HOME_DIR:` Home directory of the all files.
- `BIN_DIR:` Must contains all binaries and executables.
- `ETC_DIR:` Must contains all the configurations.
- `DATA_DIR:` Must contains all the generated/persistent data.
- `LIB_DIR:` Must contains all the libraries/resources.
